A hospital is a healthcare institution providing patient treatment with
specialized health science and auxiliary healthcare staff and medical equipment. 
The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically has an
 emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and
 accident victims to a sudden illness. A district hospital typically is the
 major health care facility in its region, with many beds for intensive care 
and additional beds for patients who need long-term care. Specialized hospitals
 include trauma centers, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors 
(geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such 
as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease 
categories. Specialized hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared 
to general hospitals.[2] Hospitals are classified as general, specialty, or 
government depending on the sources of income received.
